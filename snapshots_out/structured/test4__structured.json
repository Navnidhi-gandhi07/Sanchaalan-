    "text": "Metro Rail Policy, 2017\nBackground and context\nIndian cities are growing rapidly. There is a need to direct growth in a planned\nmanner with adequate attention to the transport system at early stages in their\ndevelopment. Cities are witnessing fast growth in the number of personal motor\nvehicles, with severe congestion and pollution being the most visible manifestation\nof the growth in the number of motor vehicles. Efforts at remedying the situation\nwill need to focus on improving the public transport system. In several cities this\nwould require implementation of Mass Transit systems such as metro rail, bus\nrapid transit, light rail, et\nUrban Rail, popularly referred to as Metro Rail, has seen substantial growth in\nIndia in the recent years. More cities are experiencing the need for metro rail to\nmeet their day-to-day mobility requirements. Most of the metro rail projects have\nbeen financed by the central goverment in partnership with the state\ngovernments, while some have been funded by the state governments either on\ntheir own or with private partnership. Metro rail projects provide high capacity\npublic transit and are capital intensive. However, considering the rapid\nurbanization and the imminent need for enhancing mobility in cities through metro\nrail, it is imperative to explore alternative and innovative sources of funds to\nsupplement the budgetary resources. At the same time, it is also important to\nensure that the proposals are prepared and appraised in a comprehensive\nmanner to enhance urban mobility as well as the speed and quality of\nimplementation of metro projects. Its in this context that the need for a policy on\nmetro rail has been felt necessary to ensure that such systems are decided upon\nand implemented in the most sustainable manner from the social, economic and\nenvironmental perspectives.\nThe following are the prevalent broad models of financing metro rail in India:\nThe existing 50:50 Joint Venture model that is predominantly the major model\navailable for the financing and organization structure was started with Delhi Metro\nRail Corporation and later followed in other metros like Mumbai Line-3, Chennai,\nBangalore, Nagpur, Lucknow, Kochi and Ahmedabad.\n‘The second model is that of full funding by the central government. Examples of\nthis model are the first metro in the city of Calcutta (now Kolkata) by Indian\nRailways, followed by East-West corridor in Kolkata being implemented on a\n74:26 equity sharing between Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Urban\nDevelopment respectively.\nThe thitd model is that of complete funding by state government; examples are\nMetro rail in Jaipur and Monorail in Mumbai.\nThe other model is the Public Private Partnership (PPP). Mumbai Metro Line-1\nand Hyderabad metro rail have been taken up with Viability Gap Funding (VGF)\nfrom Government of India. The Rapid Metro in Gurugram is an initiative of\nGovernment of Haryana where full funding is by the private concessionaire.\nBenefits of Mass Rapid Transit Systems\nMass Rapid Transit Systems in urban areas not only facilitate easy and quick\nmovement of people but also have a positive impact on the economic growth and.\nquality of life. This results in increased income and various benefits to the society",

Mass Rapid Transit Systems\ntend to reduce per capita vehicle ownership and usage and encourage more\ncompact & walkable development pattern which provide developmental benefits to\nthe society. Reduction in cost and time of travel lowers the cost of production of\ngoods and services which significantly improves city's competitiveness. One of the\nsignificant contributions is substantial reduction in per capita pollution emission\nbringing down various chronic diseases; hence, results in huge public health\nbenefits\nOptions of Mass Rapid Transit Systems(MRTS)\n‘The mass transit systems in cities! urban agglomeration can be broadly classified\ninto the following 5 categories:\na Busways and Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS): Busways are\nphysically demarcated bus lanes along the main carriageway with a\nsegregated corridor for movement of buses only. At the intersections, the\nbuses may be given priority over other modes through a signalling system.\nBRTS, is an enhanced form of a busway which incorporates features such\nas facilities for pedestrians, Non-Motorised Vehicles (NMV) and many other\nassociated infrastructures including operations and control mechanism.\nb. Light Rail Transit (LRT): LAT is generally at-grade rail based mass transit\nsystem, which is generally segregated from the main carriageway.\nTramways: These are at-grade rail based system that are not segregated\nand often move in mixed traffic conditions.\n4 Metro Rail: Metro rail is a fully segregated rail based mass transit system,\nwhich could be at grade, elevated or underground. Due to its physical\nsegregation and system technology, metro rail can have a very high\ncapacity of 40,000 — 80,000 passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD).\nMetro systems also include monorails, which, however, has lower capacities\nand higher maintenance cost.\ne. Regional Rail: Regional rail caters to passenger services within a larger\nurban agglomerate or metropolitan area connecting the outskirts to the\ncenter of the city. The services have greater number of halts at smaller\ndistances compared to long distance railways but fewer halts and higher\nspeeds compared to metro rail. Regional rail are common in large\nmetropolitan cities and help in decongesting the city center by providing\nsafe, and speedy access to the city center for commuters residing in less\ncongested suburbs.\nChoice of Metro Rail as a Mode of Mass Transit: The choice of a particular\nMRTS will depend on a variety of factors like demand, capacity, cost and ease of\nimplementation. A BRT or LRT systems at grade may require linear pathway to be\ncarved out of existing land if additional space cannot be made available on the\nsideways and will reduce the space for other traffic depending on the width of\nexisting roads. LRTs and Tramways without horizontal separation will have\nreduced speed and hence reduced capacity. The capacity of MATS is generally\ndenoted by passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD). A BRTS typically has a\ncapacity of 10,000-15,000 PPHPD on a single lane but can be enhanced with\nadditional lanes. Comparatively metro rail systems are able to carry much higher\npassenger volumes of 60,000 PPHPD and can go up to 80,000. Such rail based",

A system approach should be applied in the planning of\nmulti-modal transport systems in a city. For, this, a city can be represented by\nland use zones superimposed with a matching transport networks. By treating the\nurban area as a system, and recognizing the interactions between land use, traffic\nand transport, it is possible to predict future requirements and accordingly\nevaluate alternative modes for the most optimum mobility plan for the city.\nTherefore, a Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP), is a mandatory prerequisite for\nplanning metro rail in any city. Cities having a population of two million and more\nmay start planning for mass transit systems including metro rail based on the\nCMP.\nIntegration between various modes like roadway, railways, non-motorized\ntransport, and other modes of transport enhances the mobility of the citizens and\nencourages public transport. Existing railway suburban services or circular rail\nsystems, if any, should be integrated with the metro rail and other transport\nmodes. It is imperative that the various service providers collaborate through\nsigning of @ Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), to provide seamless\nintegration between the various modes.\nFor integrated approach in planning and management of urban transport, State\nGovernments should constitute Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA)\nas a statutory body. This Authority would prepare Comprehensive Mobility Plan for\nthe city, organize investments in urban transport infrastructure, establish effective\ncoordination among various urban transport agencies, manage the Urban\nTransport Fund (UTF) etc.\n‘As metro rail systems operate in the urban arena, it would be worthwhile\nconsidering a stake of the local body like municipal corporations or city\ndevelopment authorities in the agency implementing and/or operating the metro\nrail system in a city.\nFor metro projects in metropolitan region, which transcend state boundaries, there\nis a need for the governments to synergize their efforts in providing a",

Though they have a life of 100 years and beyond, due to\nthe nature of construction, the flexibility in design changes after the construction is\nvery limited. Hence, they should be planned and executed with a longer future\nperspective. Being a high capacity transport system, they are most suited for\ngrowing cities having prospective increase in population over several years.\nTherefore, the metro rail systems are best suited for cities with teeming population\nand favorable future growth prospects. Further, they should be decided upon with\ndue care and after a systematic and unbiased analysis of different alternatives. In\nthis context, the spatial pattern of a city is important. Cities with a well spread out\nspatial pattern, even if they have a high population, may not have sufficient\nnumber of corridors with adequate density to justify investments in a metro. Yet\ncities with a linear spatial pattern may justify a metro even at lower population\nlevels as they have fewer corridors and each would have a high traffic density. A\ncomparative analysis of alternate modes should be an essential requirement for\nthe transit mode selection. The mode which matches the demand projections over\nthe project lite cycle and has the least cost should be chosen.\nThe alternative analysis report will have to be necessarily incorporated in the\nproject report while seeking central assistance. To make the analysis comparable\namong various alternatives, a horizon of 30 years or more may be taken for\nforecasting the cost and revenue variables.\nProject Report\nThe project report will be the key document for assessing the feasibility of a metro\nproject and the issue of central assistance. The report should examine the techno\n= economic feasibility and include provision of infrastructure for integration of\nvarious modes of transport, last mile connectivity, seamless transfer between\nvarious modes through common payment instrument and universally accessible\ninfrastructure. Pricing of urban transport is a public policy issue and should be\naimed at encouraging public transport. Therefore, it should be determined in a\nmanner that it may incentivize modal shift from private vehicles. Pricing of metro\nrail should not be seen as a mere tool for enhancing financial viability as this will\ndefeat the very purpose of having a high capacity mass transit system which\nbrings in greater economic, social and environmental benefits to the city. Financial\nsupport of state government/ city authorities to ensure good financial health of the\nagency implementing’ operating the metro rail project will be essential and will\nneed to be provided within a well-defined framework.\nAs per global practice, urban transport projects, including urban rail, are treated as\nPublic projects which deliver public good. Therefore, appraisal of metro rail\nprojects should entail economic and social cost benefit analysis. Metro rail\nprojects provide larger economic and social benefits to the society in terms of\nreduction in cost and time of travel, substantial reduction in per capita pollution\nemissions resulting in reduction in chronic diseases, reduction in road accidents,\nbringing down noise pollution etc. Enhancing mobility catalyzes the economic\ndevelopment and improves the livability of a city. Hence, while appraising such\nproject proposals the economic and social viability may be assessed. The",

Lower travel distances, vastly\nreducing energy consumption and significantly lowering emissions should be the\nobjective of such investments, along with faster mode of travel. Towards this end,\nallied investments in expanding utility capacity to densify areas around metro\nstations should be a requirement and this should be adequately covered in the\nproject proposal report/ Detailed Project Report (DPR).\n‘As metto rail systems are high capacity systems with large congregations of\npeople during the peak hours, it is essential that the security and safety of the\nsystem is planned accordingly. As security is a function of the State, it needs to be\nprovided by the State.\nEnhancing the Viability of Metro Rail Projects\nBecause of the well acknowledged role of metro rail in reducing urban transport\nrelated problems, such as congestion, air and noise pollution, accidents and at the\nsame time providing faster and safer mode of mass transport, more and more\ncities world over are providing rail based urban transport systems for their\ncommuters. Public mass transport systems serve the economic and social\nrequirements of a growing city and therefore need to be appraised using a socio-\neconomic framework. Nevertheless, all efforts should be made to reduce costs\nand enhance revenues through various innovative means.\nEnhancing Revenues\nFeeder System to Metro Rail: Every proposal for Metro Rail should necessarily\ninclude proposals for feeder systems that help to enlarge the catchment area of\neach metro station at least to 5 kms.
