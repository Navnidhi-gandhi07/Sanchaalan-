The social purpose of such\nprojects can never be ignored, however, atthe same time itis of utmost\nimportance fo run these systems with efficiency comparable to the private\nsector. These purposes can be served by creating an SPV independent of\nthe bureaucratic controls and vested with sulfcient powers 10 run the\nsystem independently or be evolving some form of Publc Private\npartnership which would bing together the strengths of both the public and\nprivate sectors. The Delhi metro model is the SPV model which has been\nable to construct and run the system efficiently without compromising the\n‘Social objective.\n10.522 SPV Approach: The Corporate model involves the formation of a special\npurpose vehicle (SPV) to own/implement and also to operate the project.\n‘There is 2 possiblity/potential of involving some private sector ently as\n‘equily holder. The nancial structure ofthe project ean then be determined\nin'such a way thal a part ofthe capital cost is contrbuted as equity andthe\n‘emaining is borrowed as senior of subordinate deb from the government,\nfinancial institutions, banks or bilateral / multilateral funding agencies.\n‘Another source of funding which has been extensively used in Hong Kong\nis funds from realestate development for financing capital expenditure. In\nthis case upfront contribution required from the equiy holders is much loss\nthan the project cost, The debt and the interest there on are repaid by the\nSSPV from its net revenue streams. Long time debt is normally possible only\nWhen government guarantees are made available for repayment of loan as\nwell as for the interest charges there on. Because of the need for high\nvolume of debts, the project viabllty depends toa large extent onthe rate of\ninterest and the tenure of the debt. The SPV, being a corporate body. has\nlexi in implementation and operation’ of the project. It can be\nponsive to customer requifement and can allempt various ways of\nrevenue augmentation. SPV being 2 corporate body is lable to pay\nCorporate tax and other taxes if applicable. The above model can be further\nimproved upon i alter construction the SPV hands over the operations and\nmaintenance of the same o a private body\n1052.9 PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS\n11523.1 ~The various forms Public private partnerships can take are Supply and\nservice contracts, Management contracts, Leases, Concessions, Joint\nVentures and Divestiure. Supply and service contracts and management\nContracts are in the nature of contracts awarded to a private parly as out\n‘ourced jobs or management of the operations. Concessions not only give\nthe private operator the responsibilty of O8M of utlity asset but also for\ninvestment. The ownership remains With the government bul full use rights\nvest with the operator. Concessions are a form of lease in which the\nContractor agrees to make certain fixed investments and retains the use of\nthe assets for a longer contract period. In this approach, the state (or\n‘municipality or other public entity) delogates the right to provide a service to\nthe private sector and yet retains some control over the sector by\n‘DPR for Armedabad wero 108",

This may take\nthe form of lease and operate (or affermage) contract, under which the\nprivate contractor i responsible at his own risk for providing the service,\nincluding operation and mainlonance of the infrastructure against payment\nal a lease fee. The other forms of concession could be BOOT/BOT/BOO.\n‘These are used generaly Tor Greenliad projects. The concessionare in\nsuch projects is also responsible for building and financing now\ninvestments, At the end of the concession term the sector assets are\nfelumed to the state. BOO (build own operate) is a similar scheme but it\ndoes not involve transfer of assets. All these forms of concession stipulate\ntransferring of the right and the obligation to provide an infrastucture\n‘service to a private company. This company takes over responsiblity forthe\n‘operations and at least for a par ofthe commercial risk of service provision\n‘The concessionaire is, by and large, held responsible for achieving\nspectied results in service delivery and is given some freedom to choose\nthe means for meeting those targets.\n105.232 Tho success of this type of contracts depends on their duration which\nfellects the number ‘of years the investors need to recoup ther\ninvestment. In the French siyle concessions (aifermage) the assats return\nto the stale at the end of the period tree of charge or for a nominal\namount. The public authority remains responsible for financing most\ninvestments; hence, alfermage are shorter (10-15 years) than Greenfield\nBOTs or concessions requiring major upfront capital expenditures. In the\nlaller eases these can exceed 30 years\n105233 The concessionaire approach has nol been adopted in the rail based\nurban transit system in India because the project construction costs aze\nvery high. This naturally involves requirement of huge amount of debt to\nbe raised from the market sources to undertake such a project. The\nhighway sector has been quite successful in the country in developing\nHighway projects through the BOT .Power sector has’ a very limited\nexperience of project development under BOO route.\n10523.5 There is no available history to lusty the development of mega transport\nprojects under BOT route in india except in the case of Konkan Railway\nCorporation. KCL was the first effort by the Indian Raliways in the form\n‘of 4 corporate enierpice for the construction of a raliway tack.
